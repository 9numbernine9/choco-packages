    <description><![CDATA[MSYS2 is a software distro and building platform for Windows.

At its core is an independent rewrite of MSYS, based on modern Cygwin (POSIX compatibility layer) and MinGW-w64 with the aim of better interoperability with native Windows software. It provides a bash shell, Autotools, revision control systems and the like for building native Windows applications using MinGW-w64 toolchains.

It features a package management system to provide easy installation of packages, Pacman. It brings many powerful features such as dependency resolution and simple complete system upgrades, as well as straight-forward package building.

## NOTES

The MSYS2 archive will be extracted to Chocolatey's **BinRoot** (usually **C:\\Tools\\**). The 32bit variant uses an **msys32\\** root folder and the 64bit variant uses **msys64\\** respectively. The MSYS2 root folder will be appended to `%PATH%`. It contains the **msys2\_shell.bat**, **mingw32\_shell.bat**, and **mingw64\_shell.bat** scripts. No **bin\\** folders will be added to `%PATH%`. After unpacking, MSYS2 will be automatically initialized and updated with Pacman according to the [official instructions](https://msys2.github.io).

MSYS2 itself will not be removed on uninstalling the Chocolatey package and will not be downloaded and extracted again (even if the MSYS2 archive version has changed) on updating or reinstalling the Chocolatey package. The existing MSYS2 will just be updated with Pacman.

Chocolatey MSYS2 offers an extra **msystem.bat** script in its package folder (which will also be appended to `%PATH%`). The script can be used to activate and switch **MSYS**, **MINGW32**, and **MINGW64** environments inside a CMD shell without running Bash. It will prepend the appropriate **bin\\** folders to `%PATH%`. **MSYS** mode additionally provides **bash.bat** and **pacman.bat** wrapper scripts and according auto-completion scripts for Clink. Call `msystem /?` after installation or look at the top of the script file for more details. These extra features and even more (like better integration with other shell environments, a better **bash.bat**, and more wrapper scripts for tools like `makepkg`, ..., and an according PowerShell module) will be moved from the Chocolatey MSYS2 package to separate projects, which will then be installable as MSYS2 packages, of course auto-installed by Chocolatey MSYS2 :)
