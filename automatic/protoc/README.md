# chocolatey-protoc
Chocolatey package for the prebuilt 
[Protocol Buffers Compiler](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads).

## Overview

Protocol Buffers (a.k.a., protobuf) are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. You can find protobuf's documentation on the Google Developers site.

## Features

- Flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler.
- You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages. 
- You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled against the "old" format.
