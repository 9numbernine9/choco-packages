## Run OpenShift locally

Minishift is a tool that helps you run OpenShift locally by running a single-node OpenShift cluster inside a VM. You can try out OpenShift or develop with it, day-to-day, on your local host.

Minishift uses libmachine for provisioning VMs, and OpenShift Origin for running the cluster. The code base is forked from the Minikube project.

#### Note: Windows support is limited to 64bit systems.
