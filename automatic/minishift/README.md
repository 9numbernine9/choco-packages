## Run OpenShift 3.x locally

Minishift is a tool that helps you run OpenShift locally by running a single-node OpenShift 3.x cluster inside a VM. You can try out OpenShift or develop with it, day-to-day, on your local host.

Minishift uses libmachine for provisioning VMs, and OpenShift Origin for running the cluster. The code base is forked from the Minikube project.

#### Note: Minishift runs OpenShift 3.x clusters. Due to different installation methods, OpenShift 4.x clusters are not supported. To run OpenShift 4.x locally, use CodeReady Containers.
