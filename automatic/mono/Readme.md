Mono is a software platform designed to allow developers to easily create cross platform applications. Sponsored by Novell, Mono is an open source implementation of Microsoftâ€™s .NET Framework based on the ECMA standards for C# and the Common Language Runtime. A growing family of solutions and an active and enthusiastic contributing community is helping position Mono to become the leading choice for development of Linux applications.


## Features
- [Multi-Platform][]: Runs on *Linux*, *OS X*, *BSD* and *Microsoft Windows*, including *x86*, *x86-64*, *ARM*, *s390*, *PowerPC* and much more.
- [Multi-Language][]: Develop in *C# 4.0* (including LINQ and `dynamic`), *VB 8*, *Java*, *Python*, *Ruby*, *Eiffel*, *F#*, *Oxygene* and more.
- **Binary Compatible**: Built on an implementation of the *ECMA's Common Language Infrastructure* and *C#*.
- [Microsoft Compatible API][]: Run *ASP.NET*, *ADO.NET*, *Silverlight* and *Windows.Forms* applications without recompilation.
- [Open Source, Free Software][Open Source]: Mono's runtime, compilers, and libraries are distributed using the MIT license.

## Notes
- Starting from package version 5.8.0.127 and onwards 64bit is supported, unfortunately the 64bit version does not contain the GTK# runtime. Please either install the 32bit edition (`choco install mono --x86`), or the [gtksharp](https://chocolatey.org/packages/gtksharp) package if this is needed.
