GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS and FTP, the most widely-used Internet protocols. It is a non-interactive commandline tool, so it may easily be called from scripts, cron jobs, terminals without X-Windows support, etc.

## Features

GNU Wget has many features to make retrieving large files or mirroring entire web or FTP sites easy, including:

* Can resume aborted downloads, using REST and RANGE
* Can use filename wild cards and recursively mirror directories
* NLS-based message files for many different languages
* Optionally converts absolute links in downloaded documents to relative, so that downloaded documents may link to each other locally
* Runs on most UNIX-like operating systems as well as Microsoft Windows
* Supports HTTP proxies
* Supports HTTP cookies
* Supports persistent HTTP connections
* Unattended / background operation
* Uses local file timestamps to determine whether documents need to be re-downloaded when mirroring
* GNU Wget is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
